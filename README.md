## Overview <a id="Overview"></a>
**Background.** Migration is becoming a major force in the dynamics of population allocation, with climate-induced migration receiving growing attention. However, the role played by human climate endeavors is continually overlooked in existing climate-induced migration studies, including empirical studies, meta-analyses, and future projections. To address this gap, we combine machine learning with attribution mapping to provide robust evidence on the impacts of heat-related policies (HPs) on migration patterns across U.S. counties. 
**Discription.** This repository consists of four main parts of code. The first one is to fine-tune the pre-trained DistilBERT model using our annotated dataset, which in turn predicts the classification to which the heat-related policies(HPs) belongs; the second one is to investigate the causal effect of HPs on migration, which mainly consists of our proposed G2SLS method and the traditional TWFE, OLS method; the third is to estimate the heterogeneity of the effect across geographical regions and policy types; and the fourth is to calculate the mediating impact of climate-related public opinion on migration due to HPs.
