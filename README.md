## Overview <a id="Overview"></a>
### **Background** 
Migration is becoming a major force in the dynamics of population allocation, with climate-induced migration receiving growing attention. However, the role played by human climate endeavors is continually overlooked in existing climate-induced migration studies, including empirical studies, meta-analyses, and future projections. To address this gap, we combine machine learning with attribution mapping to provide robust evidence on the impacts of heat-related policies (HPs) on migration patterns across U.S. counties. 
### **Discription** 
This repository consists of four main parts of code. The first one is to fine-tune the pre-trained DistilBERT model using our annotated dataset, which in turn predicts the classification to which the heat-related policies(HPs) belongs; the second one is to investigate the causal effect of HPs on migration, which mainly consists of our proposed G2SLS method and the traditional TWFE, OLS method; the third is to estimate the heterogeneity of the effect across geographical regions and policy types; and the fourth is to calculate the mediating impact of climate-related public opinion on migration due to HPs. 

## System Requirements <a id="SystemRequirements"></a>
The code to categorize heat-related policies ran on a 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090.  
Other codes were employed on a system with the following specifications:
- operating system: Windows 10
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H
- memory (RAM): 16GB
- disk storage: 500GB
- GPU: 1x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650

The main software requirements are Python 3.9 with transformers 4.31 and torch 2.0. Other libraries used include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy, statsmodels, shapely, and geopandas.

## Installation guide <a id="Installationguide"></a>
